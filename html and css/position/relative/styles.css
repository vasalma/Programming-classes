/* 
    Relative positioning
    -------------------
    The element is positioned relative to its normal position within the document. The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, but can be offset by using the top, right, bottom, left properties. The element will not be taken out of the document flow, meaning it will still take up space in the document and affect the layout of other elements.
