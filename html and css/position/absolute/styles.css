    Absolute positioning
    -------------------
    The element is positioned absolutely according to its containing block. The containing block is the nearest ancestor that has a position relative. The element is removed from the normal document flow and does not affect the layout of other elements. The element will be positioned according to the top, right, bottom, left properties. The element can be positioned outside of its containing block if so desired.
